# File-storage-for-mid1800-history
I am apage007. I grow trees and have made many mistakes. I try to learn from them so they are welcome.
There is a lot that appears to be missing in the published histories for the time around the Civil War in the USA. Add information that may fill in some blanks.

We have found that economics/fraud is filled with fraud and no responsibility for the damage done because of business cycle short falls. Long term projects may produce more value for the community than the economic outcome of the production activity. This is especially true when the PTB are bent on destroying local economies.
Be Well.
